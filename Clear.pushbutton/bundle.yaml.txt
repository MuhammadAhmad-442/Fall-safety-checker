We are back!

In an update to my previous post, this version filters the floor boundaries above 6 feet and splits them into smaller segments. It then checks for boundaries within a region (currently set to 30 cm), marks them as unsafe if 70% of the edge is exposed (prevents intersecting walls and elements from being misclassified as boundaries), and selects and highlights unsafe boundaries red.

Upcoming versions will include:

- Export options

- Option for detecting floor gaps
